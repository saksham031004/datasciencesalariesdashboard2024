üí∞ Data Science Global Salary Trends Dashboard
A powerful, interactive business intelligence tool to analyze and compare data science and AI job salaries across different job titles, company sizes, geographical locations, and experience levels globally.

üéØ Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of the global compensation landscape for data-related roles. It is designed to help job seekers negotiate salaries, business owners benchmark their compensation packages, and analysts understand prevailing market rates, identifying key factors that influence earning potential in the data science industry.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies, as suggested by the file format:

1.üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì The main platform used for data modeling, visualization design, and report creation.

2.üìÇ Power Query (M Language) ‚Äì Utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and integrating the raw salary dataset.

3.üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Employed for creating calculated measures and key performance indicators (KPIs) like average salary, salary ranges by location, and comparative growth metrics.

4.üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Structured relationships between tables (e.g., jobs, companies, currencies) to enable robust filtering and cross-analysis.

5.üìÅ File Format ‚Äì Developed as a Power BI Report file (.pbix).

üíæ Data Source
The project likely uses a comprehensive dataset of reported salaries for data-related positions.

1.Source: Kaggle, Public Salary Datasets, or Aggregated Job Market Data (Replace with actual source)

2.Data Content: The dataset contains records of thousands of reported salaries, typically including fields such as:

3.Job Title (e.g., Data Scientist, ML Engineer, Data Analyst)

4.Salary in USD and Local Currency

5.Company Location and Size

6.Employee Residence

7.Experience Level (e.g., Entry-level, Senior, Executive)

‚ú® Features / Highlights
This dashboard is built to answer critical questions about compensation in the data science field.

1.Business Problem The opaque nature of compensation makes salary negotiation challenging and prevents companies from accurately benchmarking their pay structures. Key questions like:

2.What is the average salary for a Senior Data Scientist in London versus New York?

3.How does company size correlate with salary in remote vs. in-office roles?

4.Which job titles have experienced the fastest salary growth? ...are difficult to answer without aggregated, interactive data.

5.Goal of the Dashboard To provide a highly interactive and intuitive tool that visually represents complex salary data, supporting both job candidates and employers in making informed, data-driven financial decisions.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical)

1.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displaying the overall Average Salary (USD), Top Job Title by Salary, and Top-Paying Country.

2.Salary Distribution by Role: A detailed bar chart showing the Average Salary for Top Job Titles, such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Machine Learning Engineer, often sorted for easy comparison.

3.Geographical Salary Heatmap: A map visualization highlighting average or median salaries by Country, allowing users to filter for regional disparities.

4.Experience Level Impact: A visual breakdown (e.g., stacked bar or column chart) demonstrating how salary grows significantly from Entry-Level to Executive/Director roles.

5.Company Size Analysis: A comparison showing the difference in average salaries offered by small (S), medium (M), and large (L) companies.

6.Remote Work Comparison: Visuals illustrating how salaries differ for employees categorized as fully Remote, Hybrid, or In-Office.

Business Impact & Insights

1.Candidate Empowerment: Job seekers can use the dashboard to validate offers and demand competitive compensation based on market data.

2.Recruitment Strategy: Companies can use insights to optimize budget allocation for specific roles and locations to attract top talent.

3.Market Trend Analysis: Analysts can monitor shifting trends in compensation, identifying emerging high-value roles and markets.
